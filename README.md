# Basic React App for Cal-Heatmap

## Introduction

This is a basic app to show how to use the Cal-Heatmap library (cal-heatmap.com) in React.
The main goal of this Cal-Heatmap demo is to be as simple and straightforward as possible.

The maintainer of Cal-Heatmap, wa0x6e, also created a simple React app as a demo for Cal-Heatmap: https://github.com/wa0x6e/cal-heatmap-react-starter.

It's good to check it out if you want to get started with Cal-Heatmap using the Next.js framework.
